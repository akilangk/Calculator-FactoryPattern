**Program Statement**

* A program to build a calculator which performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.

* This program follows the Factory Method Design Pattern.

**Factory Method Design Pattern:**

**Definition:**

* A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the
  subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

* The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.

**Advantages:**

* Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create.
* It promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code. 
  That means the code interacts solely with the resultant interface or abstract class, so that it will work
  with any classes that implement that interface or that extends that abstract class.
